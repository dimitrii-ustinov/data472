# Insights

The information is taken from OpenData portal. However, the information about the seats is not intuitively accessible from google maps or CCC website. It is challenging to navigate and find the data. It is important to provide easy and intuitive access to this data to elderly, disabled and people with young children.
This information can be shown on a map using lat and lon.
